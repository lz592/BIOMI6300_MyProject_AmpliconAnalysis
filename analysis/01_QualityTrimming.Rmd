**INTERPRETATION #1 of Pre-QC:**
*Here, in this location of your analyses, please insert a description of the interpretation you draw regarding your plots. You must note anything important about the figure you’ve created about your data including any spikes in quality and also the general trend of the raw QC plots.*

These plots showing the pre-QC quality scores of the raw sequencing data for the project, which aggregate 29 sequencing files, and were generated with 2x300 bp sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq Sequencer:

1. Early Bases Have a Drop in Quality (~Cycle 0-10)
Both forward and reverse reads show a slight drop in quality at the beginning (~Cycle 0-10). However, this drop remains mostly above Q30, which is acceptable. 
In this case, I will use the ‘trimLeft’ parameter to trim the primers in both forward and reverse reads.

2. High Quality in Mid-Read (~Cycle 10-210)
The sequencing quality is stable and above ~25-30 across most of the sequencing cycle/read (Cycle 10-300). This suggests that most of the read length is high-quality and can be retained.

3. Decline in Reverse Reads After ~210 Cycles
The reverse reads exhibit a notable drop in quality after ~210 cycles, dropping below Q25.
The decline is more severe in reverse reads than in forward reads, indicating a high sequencing error rate. 
This suggests that truncating the reverse reads around Cycle ~200-220 might improve quality. Therefore, I will truncate the read using ‘truncLen = 210’ to remove those final 90 poor-quality bases at the end of the read. 

4. Forward Reads Maintain Quality Slightly Longer (~Cycle 230-300)
The forward reads show a more gradual decline in quality after Cycle 230, but they remain above ~25-30 longer than the reverse reads. The final cycles (~280-300) show a steep drop in quality, which is common for Illumina sequencing. 
This suggests that truncating forward reads around Cycle ~280 to remove poor-quality bases. Therefore, I will truncate the read using ‘trunclen = 280’ to remove those final 20 poor-quality bases at the end of the read.

# Prepare a placeholder for filtered reads
```{r prep-filtered-sequences}
# Create vector of sample names from the filenames 
sample_names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(forward_reads), "_"), `[`,1) 

# Intuition Check

# Place filtered reads into filtered_fastqs_path
filtered_fastqs_path <- "/local/workdir/lz592/MyProject/data//02_filtered_fastqs"

# Intuition Check

# Filter and Trim Reads

# Assign and write out filtered fastq files

  filterAndTrim(fwd = forward_reads, filt = filtered_forward_reads,
              rev = reverse_reads, filt.rev = filtered_reverse_reads,
              maxN = 0,
              # The sequence quality is not bad, so I choose to use maxEE = c(2,2)
              maxEE = c(2,2), 
              # Trim the primers sequences in the forward and reverse reads
              trimLeft = c(16, 20),
              # Trim final 20 bases in the forward & trim final 90 bases in the reverse read
              truncLen = c(280, 210),

  labs(title = "Reverse Post-QC")

# Now, let's put the two plots together

**INTERPRETATION #2 of Post-QC:**
*Here, in this location of your analyses, please insert a description of the interpretation you draw regarding your post filterAndTrim plots. Please note anything important about the figure you’ve created about your data generally speaking to your post-QC reads. What’s the general trend? In the next question, we will plot the pre- and post-QC togeter and compare them. The goal here is to evaluate the QC process.*

The plots above show the post-QC quality scores of the sequencing data after applying quality filtering and trimming. Quality filtering successfully removed poor-quality reads and trimmed low-quality tails, leading to improved overall read quality.
1. Forward Reads Post-QC
The forward reads maintain high quality (Q30+) throughout most of the read length.
A slight decline in quality is visible after ~230 cycles, but still largely above a Phred of 30.
2. Reverse Reads Post-QC
Initial bases (~0-10 cycles) remain stable, suggesting that any low-quality bases were effectively trimmed.
The mid-read section (~10-170 cycles) maintains strong Q30+ quality with minimal degradation.
A quality drop-off is still visible after ~170 cycles, but it is much less severe than before, meaning the QC process effectively removed the worst low-quality regions while preserving usable data.

# Read Retention Post-QC

# Let's calculate some statistics
read_stats_df <- 
  filtered_df %>%
  reframe(median_reads_in = median(reads.in),
          median_reads_out = median(reads.out),
          median_percent_retained = (median(reads.out)/median(reads.in)),
          max_percent_retained = max(reads.out/reads.in),
          min_percent_retained = min(reads.out/reads.in))

**INTERPRETATION #3 of Post-QC Statistics:**
*Here, in this location of your analyses, please insert a description of the interpretation you draw regarding your read retainment pre- and post-QC. Please note anything important about the three paneled figure you created above. Think about how many reads got through? Is it “enough”? Should I play with the parameters in filterAndTrim() more? If so, which parameters?*

This figure presents three panels showing how many sequences were retained after quality filtering and trimming in the DADA2 pipeline.

Panel A: Scatter Plot of Raw vs. Retained Sequences
•	X-axis: Number of raw sequences before filtering.
•	Y-axis: Number of sequences retained after filtering.
•	Pink Line: The diagonal line represents perfect retention (i.e., no sequences lost).
Interpretation of Panel A:
Most points are close to the diagonal, suggesting good read retention across samples.
Some points fall below the diagonal, indicating that a few samples lost a moderate number of reads. 
No extreme outliers, meaning no sample was unexpectedly depleted.
Overall: The filtering step was effective while preserving most sequences, ensuring sufficient data retention.

Panel B: Histogram of the Number of Sequences Retained per Sample
•	X-axis: Number of sequences retained per sample.
•	Y-axis: Number of samples with that many retained sequences.
Interpretation of Panel B:
Most samples retained between ~35,000 and 42,000 or between ~44,000 and 53,000 sequences, indicating that the majority of data was preserved. A small number of samples have lower retention, but there is no drastic loss.
Overall: The filtering process successfully retained a consistent number of reads across most samples.

Panel C: Histogram of Percent of Sequences Retained
•	X-axis: Proportion (%) of sequences retained per sample.
•	Y-axis: Number of samples at each proportion.
Interpretation of Panel C.
The majority of samples retained 75–95% of their reads, indicating successful quality filtering.
Median retention is ~93% (good); Max retention: ~95% (great); Min retention: 75% (good).

**INTERPRETATION #4 is comparing your pre-QC to your post-QC read quality:**
*Here, in this location of your analyses, please insert a description of the interpretation you draw from yor overall quality control results. Are you satisfied with your QC process?*

Quality Score Improvements
1. Forward Reads (Pre vs. Post-QC)
•	Beginning of read: The primers were trimmed at the beginning of forward and reverse reads. 
•	Middle of read: The quality remains consistently high Q30-Q40 across most cycles/bases.
•	End of read: While a slight drop in the last ~20 cycles/bases remain, the trimming step remove the lowest-quality bases.
2. Reverse Reads (Pre vs. Post-QC)
•	Beginning of read: The primers were trimmed at the beginning of forward and reverse reads.
•	Middle of read: Mid-read quality (~10-180bp) remains strong.
•	End of read: The trailing end of the reverse reads still shows some degradation, but it’s significantly improved from pre-QC. The lowest-quality bases have been trimmed, but reverse reads still have some expected drop-off after ~180 cycles (this is typical for Illumina sequencing).

# Check Render Time
```{r stop-time}
# Take the time now that we are at the end of the script
end_time <- Sys.time()
end_time 

# Echo the elapsed time
elapsed_time <- round((end_time - start_time), 3)
elapsed_time
```

# Session Information
```{r session-info}
# Ensure reproducibility 
devtools::session_info()
```

I think I have sufficiently QC'd the sequencing data, and I trust the quality of the data.
